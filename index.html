						<p>I'm pursuing a career in web programming because, for years, I hadn't yet found anything that is both enjoyable and challenging.</p><br>
						<p>I went from job to job, trying out various things, then would come home and spend my spare time pursuing my (nerdish) hobbies, such as birding, researching natural living (including solar energy, electromagnetism, plant-based diets, etc.), learning the piano, improving my horrible flexibility with yoga (when I work up the motivation), beginning woodworking using only hand tools, pondering existentialism, and many others... as well as web programming.</p><br>
						<p>Obviously, those areas require an advanced degree (which I have, but not in those fields), years of training (which I do not have), or they pay nothing (which doesn't help in our monetary-based economy; a resource-based economy is where it's at!).</p><br>
						<p>BUT, I discovered that a degree is not necessarily required in the area of web programming, so long as one knows how to actually PROGRAM. And if there is one thing I'm good at, it's learning something new on my own.</p><br>
						<p>Therefore, I have been avidly pursuing knowledge, skills, and positions in front-end web programming for about a year, after having spent the previous 3 years programming for fun. In the meantime, I'm both emotionally-fulfilled and intellectually-restless being a stay-at-home dad with my two freakin' amazing kids.</p><br>
